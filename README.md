# Word-Embedding-Analogies-PCA-Visualization
This project demonstrates word embedding analogies using the Google News Word2Vec model and visualizes semantic relationships through PCA. It extracts a subset of embeddings, performs country–capital analogy predictions, evaluates accuracy, and presents 2D PCA plots for meaningful word clusters.
